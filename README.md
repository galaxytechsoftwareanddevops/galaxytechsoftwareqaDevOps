Empowering Careers Through Software Testing & DevOps – A New Tech Initiative

Welcome to GalaxyTech Software Testing & DevOps Hub, a dedicated software testing and training platform designed to change lives.

By providing high-quality, affordable, and accessible training in Software Quality Assurance, Test Automation, and DevOps, the platform helps individuals build a successful career path in the technology world. Our mission is to fill the skills gap for those who aspire to enter the world of software technology and software quality control, but are unable to pursue higher education due to various reasons, such as lack of a degree (Bachelor’s or Master’s) or financial stability.

This initiative is specifically for individuals who are unsure about their career path, are looking to change careers, or are looking to enter the technology field from non-tech backgrounds.

Our goal is to help people in the US and beyond who are unable to find high-paying jobs due to educational background, financial difficulties, or irrelevant work experience, gain the necessary skills and enter the technology industry.

Our ultimate goal is to enable them to earn 5-6 figure incomes with the right skills and create a secure future for themselves and their families, whether at home or abroad.

Our initial programs include online tutoring and YouTube training videos on software testing, test automation, and DevOps.

This platform is especially useful for people who come from developing countries or cannot afford college but are determined to change their financial situation and build a stable future for themselves and their families.

What makes our platform different or unique is our commitment to language accessibility. Many talented individuals struggle with language barriers in learning technology and have difficulty gaining a mental and intellectual understanding of these fields and careers. For this reason, we offer our training in Pashto, Persian/Dari, Urdu and English so that those whose native language is not English can better understand technical concepts and prepare themselves for job interviews after acquiring skills and knowledge in the above fields during marketing and job search programs and self-developed interviews.

Our approach includes explaining programming terminology, software development principles, test automation concepts - software quality assurance and DevOps in their native language, so that they gain fundamental knowledge before entering the job market.

In addition to technical training, we also offer career preparation courses to familiarize students with resume building, interview techniques, and job application/CV strategies to help them land their dream job in the software and technology industry.

Our vision is to turn dreams into reality, to guide individuals on their path to professional success in QA Engineering, Test Automation, and DevOps, and to help them realize their American Dream.

Join us as we build, educate, and advance the path to career success through Software Testing and DevOps!
